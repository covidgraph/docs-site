CovidGraph has an active and friendly community. We welcome anyone who wants to use CovidGraph, help us to develop and improve it or is simply interested in what we are doing.

## Matrix & Element

We use [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) to communicate. It's a free and federated Slack. [Element](https://element.io/), formerly Riot, is the standard client for Matrix and there is ample [online guidance](https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2018/05/guide-to-matrix-riot).

## Installing Element

1. Download Element or start the web app: https://element.io/get-started
2. When asked to login/signup: create a free account on the matrix.org homeserver
3. To join our main room, click 'explore', search for our room and then click join: `#covidgraph:meet.dzd-ev.de`

It would help if you set your full name in your Element profile and if you introduced yourself in the main room.

## Structure on Matrix

We have a main room with everyone and a couple of sub groups for specific topics. We try to organize and to make sure that everyone is in the right groups. Contact Martin Preusse if you would like to be added to any of the rooms.

- CovidGraph (main room)
