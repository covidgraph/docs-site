We have great ideas and ambitions for HealthECCO, CovidGraph and the wider ecosystem of applications. We know that they can make a positive impact on the world. It's not just developers and graph experts that we are looking for. Our project has many different aspects from organisational management, marketing, community engagement, project and product management to name a few. We would be [happy to hear from you](https://covidgraph.org/contact) whatever your background and whatever your level of experience!

CovidGraph has an active and friendly community. We welcome anyone who wants to use CovidGraph, help us to develop and improve it or is simply interested in what we are doing. We are a group of volunteers and are always happy to answer questions or help new users/developers get started.

We are always on the lookout for graph enthusiasts, developers and students. We have a number of interesting challenges and ideas in the pipeline (quite literally in some cases) and by helping us we can help you build your graph, devops or NLP skills (among others).

## Website

Network & community are important. It would be great to add you to the team on our website.

We need a picture and a short profile. You should be in our Matrix room and stay in touch with the team.

## LinkedIn & Social Media

CovidGraph has anactive Twitter and LinkedIn presence and we encourage our community to engage, promote and share news about the project.

If you are an active contributor to the project, you are welcome to add a section to your LinkedInprofile to promote any work you have been doing for CovidGraph. We suggest adding a new employment section and select CovidGraph as the employer as opposed to adding a new Volunteer section as you will then appear on the people tab of CovidGraph's LinkedIn page. You can select part-time and mention in the title you choose that the role is voluntary.
