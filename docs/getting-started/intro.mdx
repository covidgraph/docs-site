# Issue Tracking

We manage and track issues, data sources and use-cases using ZenHub.
* [The CovidGraph Board](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/the-covidgraph-board-5e9c02aa9ff5df3379cdec8c/board?)
* [ZenHub Guidance](https://github.com/covidgraph/documentation/wiki/ZenHub)

CovidGraph has several active communication channels in Riot/Matrix which are good places to ask questions and find answers. As a general rule of thumb we try to ensure that we capture any useful information in ways that make it easier to find again in future. Please consider if your question may better be raised as an issue or if your observation may better be added to a wiki page and signposted from the Matrix/Riot channels. **Ultimately there is no wrong way to do things and we actively encourage engagement however you feel comfortable.**


# Help Wanted
Check the Zenhub [CovidGraph Board for any issues tagged as 'help wanted'](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/the-covidgraph-board-5e9c02aa9ff5df3379cdec8c/board?labels=help%20wanted&repos=251283493,249963498,250642826,249955741,252452561,257212226,249677899,248512309,254379086,254310898,254353397,259324438,252660505,252680515&showPRs=false). The ZenHub board includes issues from all repos but you can filter by specific repos if you prefer.




# Website

Network & community are important. It would be great to add you to the team on our website: https://covidgraph.org/team

Please reach out to Axel Morgner (@amorgner:matrix.org). We need a picture and a short profile. You should be in our Matrix room and stay in touch with the team.

# LinkedIn & Social Media

CovidGraph has anactive Twitter and LinkedIn presence and we encourage our community to engage, promote and share news about the project.

## [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/covidgraph/about/)
If you are an active contributor to the project, you are welcome to add a section to their profiles to promote any work you have been doing for CovidGraph. We suggest adding a new employment section and select CovidGraph as the employer as opposed to adding a new Volunteer section as you will then appear on the people tab of CovidGraph's LinkedIn page. You can select part-time and mention in the title you choose that the role is voluntary.

You can write JSX and use React components within your Markdown thanks to [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/).

export const Highlight = ({children, color}) => ( <span style={{
      backgroundColor: color,
      borderRadius: '2px',
      color: '#fff',
      padding: '0.2rem',
    }}>{children}</span> );

<Highlight color="#25c2a0">Docusaurus green</Highlight> and <Highlight color="#1877F2">Facebook blue</Highlight> are my favorite colors.

I can write **Markdown** alongside my _JSX_!
