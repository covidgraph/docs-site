CovidGraph is a complex network of interconnected points of information. Each point, or node, can represent different types of information, for example, a research paper, a patent, an author, an organisation, a gene etc. In the real world these things relate to each other in a variety of different ways.

> _An author writes a research paper, about a clinical trial and mentions a gene; that gene can express various tissues and has associated pathways and diseases; the author works for an organisation that holds a patent that relates to a medicinal product that treats a disease related to that gene._

The beauty of CovidGraph is that it is able to efficiently model these real world relationships and put them to work exposing previously hidden connections which can lead to high impact, fast paced innovation.


CovidGraph is a knowledge graph built in Neo4j by a dedicated community of graph enthusiasts and volunteers. CovidGraph integrates and enriches a number of public data sources including PubMed articles, clinical trials, patents and a comprehensive array of biomedical concepts.

There is a growing ecosystem of applications that help facilitate access to the data in the core knowledge graph.
